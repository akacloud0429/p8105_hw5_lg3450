# Problem 1

**Suppose you put n people in a room, and want to know the probability
that at least two people share a birthday. For simplicity, we’ll assume
there are no leap years (i.e. there are only 365 days) and that
birthdays are uniformly distributed over the year (which is actually not
the case).**

- Q1: Write a function that, for a fixed group size, randomly draws
  “birthdays” for each person; checks whether there are duplicate
  birthdays in the group; and returns TRUE or FALSE based on the result.

``` r
check_birthday = function(n) {
  #randomly draw #n birthdays from 1 to 365, allow for same bthd
  birthdays = sample(1:365, size = n, replace = TRUE)
  #logic: if length < n, duplication appears
  has_duplicate = length(unique(birthdays)) < n
  has_duplicate
}
```

- Q2: Next, run this function 10000 times for each group size between 2
  and 50. For each group size, compute the probability that at least two
  people in the group will share a birthday by averaging across the
  10000 simulation runs. Make a plot showing the probability as a
  function of group size, and comment on your results.
