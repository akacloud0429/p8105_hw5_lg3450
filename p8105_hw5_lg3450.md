# Problem 1

**Suppose you put n people in a room, and want to know the probability
that at least two people share a birthday. For simplicity, we’ll assume
there are no leap years (i.e. there are only 365 days) and that
birthdays are uniformly distributed over the year (which is actually not
the case).**

- Q1.1: Write a function that, for a fixed group size, randomly draws
  “birthdays” for each person; checks whether there are duplicate
  birthdays in the group; and returns TRUE or FALSE based on the result.

``` r
check_birthday = function(n) {
  #randomly draw #n birthdays from 1 to 365, allow for same bthd
  birthdays = sample(1:365, size = n, replace = TRUE)
  #logic: if length < n, duplication appears
  repeated_bthd = length(unique(birthdays)) < n
  repeated_bthd}
```

- Q1.2: Next, run this function 10000 times for each group size between
  2 and 50. For each group size, compute the probability that at least
  two people in the group will share a birthday by averaging across the
  10000 simulation runs.

``` r
set.seed(1)

prob_results =
  expand_grid(
    group_size = 2:50,
    iter = 1:10000) |>
  mutate(
    repeated_bthd = map_dbl(group_size, check_birthday)) |>
  group_by(group_size) |>
  summarize(
    prob_shared = mean(repeated_bthd))

prob_results
```

    ## 10         11     0.139  
    ## # ℹ 39 more rows

- Q1.3: Make a plot showing the probability as a function of group size,
  and comment on your results.

``` r
prob_results |>
  ggplot(aes(x = group_size, y = prob_shared)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_path() +
  labs(
    title = "Estimated Probability of a Shared Birthday",
    x = "Group Size",
    y = "Probability of at least one shared birthday"
  ) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = percent)
```

![](p8105_hw5_lg3450_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png)<!-- -->

The plot illustrates a clear non-linear acceleration in probability,
rather than a steady, linear increase. This simulation confirms the
“birthday paradox,” showing the 50% probability threshold is crossed
with a group size of just 23. Following this point, the probability
rapidly converges toward certainty, reaching 97% by a group size of 50.

# Problem2

- Q2.1: Make a plot showing the proportion of times the null was
  rejected (the power of the test) on the y axis and the true value of
  mu on the x axis. Describe the association between effect size and
  power.

``` r
set.seed(1)

n = 30
sigma = 5
mu_values = 0:6
n_sims = 5000
alpha = 0.05

run_one = function(mu) {
 x = rnorm(n, mean = mu, sd = sigma)
 t_out = t.test(x, mu = 0) |> tidy()
 tibble(
  true_mu = mu,
  mu_hat = as.numeric(t_out$estimate),
  p_value = t_out$p.value)}

#run all simulations for mu = 0,1,2,3,4,5,6
sim_results =
 expand_grid(true_mu = mu_values, iter = 1:n_sims) |>
 mutate(res = map(true_mu, run_one)) |>
 select(res) |>
 unnest(res) |>
 mutate(reject = p_value < alpha)

power_df =
 sim_results |>
 group_by(true_mu) |>
 summarize(power = mean(reject))

power_plot =
 power_df |>
 ggplot(aes(x = true_mu, y = power)) +
 geom_point(size = 2) +
 geom_line() +
 scale_y_continuous(labels = percent, limits = c(0, 1)) +
 labs(
  title = "Power of One-Sample t-test vs. Effect Size",
  x = "True Value of μ (Effect Size)",
  y = "Power (Proportion of Null Rejections)") +
 theme_minimal()

power_plot
```

![](p8105_hw5_lg3450_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png)<!-- -->

Based on the plot, the association between and power is strong,
positive, and non-linear. When the effect size is 0 (namely the null
hypothesis is true), the power is low, at approximately 5%. As the
effect size increases, the power (the probability of correctly detecting
the effect) rises rapidly. The power is low for a small effect size, but
approaches 100% for large effect sizes. In short, the larger the true
effect, the more likely the test is to detect it.

- Q2.2: Make a plot showing the average estimate of mu on the y axis and
  the true value of mu on the x axis. Make a second plot (or overlay on
  the first) the average estimate of mu only in samples for which the
  null was rejected on the y axis and the true value of mu on the x
  axis. Is the sample average of mu across tests for which the null is
  rejected approximately equal to the true value of mu? Why or why not?

``` r
est_df =
 sim_results |>
 group_by(true_mu) |>
 summarize(
  avg_all   = mean(mu_hat),
  avg_rejected = mean(mu_hat[reject], na.rm = TRUE)) |>
 pivot_longer(
  cols = c(avg_all, avg_rejected),
  names_to = "type",
  values_to = "avg_mu_hat")

estimate_plot =
 est_df |>
 ggplot(aes(x = true_mu, y = avg_mu_hat, color = type)) +
 geom_point(size = 2) +
 geom_line() +
 geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, linetype = "dashed") +
 scale_color_discrete(
  labels = c(
   avg_all = "Average (All Samples)",
   avg_rejected = "Average (Rejected Only)")) +
 labs(
  title = "Average μ̂ vs True μ",
  x = "True μ",
  y = "Average μ̂",
  color = "Estimate Type") +
 theme_minimal()

estimate_plot
```

![](p8105_hw5_lg3450_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)<!-- -->

No. The sample average of $\hat{\mu}$ among tests that reject the null
is not equal to the true value of $\mu$ and it is consistently biased
upward.

This happens because of selection bias. When we keep only “significant”
results (p \< 0.05), we disproportionately include simulations where
$\hat{\mu}$ happened to be larger than the truth (far from 0), and
exclude those closer to 0 (often non-significant). As a result,
underestimates are removed while overestimates remain, causing the
average of the rejected samples to be inflated.

# Problem3

**The Washington Post has gathered data on homicides in 50 large U.S.
cities and made the data available through a GitHub repository here. You
can read their accompanying article here.**

- Q3.1: Describe the raw data. Create a city_state variable
  (e.g. “Baltimore, MD”) and then summarize within cities to obtain the
  total number of homicides and the number of unsolved homicides (those
  for which the disposition is “Closed without arrest” or “Open/No
  arrest”).

``` r
homicides = read_csv("../homicide-data.csv")
```

``` r
unsolved_types = c("Open/No arrest", "Closed without arrest")

city_summary = homicides |>
  mutate(city_state = paste(city, state, sep = ", ")) |>
  mutate(unsolved = disposition %in% unsolved_types) |>
  group_by(city_state) |>
  summarize(
    total_homicides = n(),                      
    unsolved_homicides = sum(unsolved, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  arrange(desc(total_homicides))

print(head(city_summary, 10))
```

    ## 10 New Orleans, LA             1434                930

The dataset contains 52179 individual homicide records and 12 variables
describing each case.

Key geographic variables include `city` and `state`, which identify the
location. In total, the dataset spans 50 distinct cities. For more
precise spatial analysis, the dataset also provides the specific `lat`
(latitude) and `lon` (longitude) for each incident.

The dataset also includes victim demographic variables, such as their
`victim_first` and `victim_last` name. For analysis, the most relevant
demographic fields are `victim_race` and `victim_sex`, both of which are
categorical variables, and `victim_age`.

The disposition variable has three distinct levels. Running 25674, 2922,
23583 counts the total number of cases for each of these levels, which
are: ‘Closed by arrest,’ ‘Open/No arrest,’ and ‘Closed without arrest.’

- Q3.2: For the city of Baltimore, MD, use the prop.test function to
  estimate the proportion of homicides that are unsolved; save the
  output of prop.test as an R object, apply the broom::tidy to this
  object and pull the estimated proportion and confidence intervals from
  the resulting tidy dataframe.

``` r
final_baltimore_estimates =
  homicides |>
  filter(city == "Baltimore", state == "MD") |>
  summarize(
    total_homicides = n(),
    unsolved_homicides = sum(disposition %in% unsolved_types)) |>
  mutate(
    prop_test = list(
      prop.test(
        x = unsolved_homicides,
        n = total_homicides))) |>
  mutate(tidy_res = map(prop_test, broom::tidy)) |>
  select(tidy_res) |>
  unnest(tidy_res) |>
  select(
    estimate_proportion = estimate,
    conf_low = conf.low,
    conf_high = conf.high)

print(final_baltimore_estimates)
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 3
    ##   estimate_proportion conf_low conf_high
    ##                 <dbl>    <dbl>     <dbl>
    ## 1               0.646    0.628     0.663

- Q3.3: Now run prop.test for each of the cities in your dataset, and
  extract both the proportion of unsolved homicides and the confidence
  interval for each. Do this within a “tidy” pipeline, making use of
  purrr::map, purrr::map2, list columns and unnest as necessary to
  create a tidy dataframe with estimated proportions and CIs for each
  city.

``` r
final_estimates =
  city_summary |>
  mutate(
    tidy_results = purrr::map2(
      .x = unsolved_homicides, 
      .y = total_homicides,
      .f = ~ tidy(prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)))) |>
  unnest(tidy_results) |>
  select(
    city_state,
    total_homicides,
    unsolved_homicides,
    estimate_proportion = estimate,
    conf_low = conf.low,
    conf_high = conf.high
  ) |>
  arrange(desc(estimate_proportion))

print(final_estimates)
```

- Q3.4: Create a plot that shows the estimates and CIs for each city –
  check out geom_errorbar for a way to add error bars based on the upper
  and lower limits. Organize cities according to the proportion of
  unsolved homicides.

``` r
homicide_ci_plot =
  final_estimates |>
  ggplot(aes(x = estimate_proportion, 
             y = fct_reorder(city_state, estimate_proportion))) +
  geom_errorbar(

    width = 0.2, 
    color = "darkgrey", 
    alpha = 0.8) +
  geom_point(
    aes(size = total_homicides), 
    color = "darkblue", 
    alpha = 0.6) +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +
  labs(
    title = "Unsolved Homicide Rate by City",
    x = "Estimated Proportion of Unsolved Homicides",
    y = "City",
    size = "Total Homicides") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 8),
    panel.grid.major.y = element_blank())

ggsave("homicide_city_CIs_plot.png", homicide_ci_plot, width = 45, height = 45, dpi = 300)
